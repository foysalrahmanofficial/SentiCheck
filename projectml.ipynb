After leaving the stage, he walks out into the alley and finds a group of kids picking on another because of his religion. Instead of yelling at the boys (or helping them for that matter), Sinatra delivers a nice civics lesson on religious toleration and equates prejudice with fascism. The kids seem to get the lesson but then, out of the blue, Sinatra begins singing a song that, frankly (get it?), kids would have hated. He had a lovely voice but unfortunately I think this detracted from the excellent message he gave to the kids about tolerance.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE! It's so bad it's not even laughable. The special effects (did I say \\\"special\\\"?) were probably achieved spending a couple of grand, the acting is terrible and the script should have ended up in the trash bin after the first read by the studio that decided to take on this miserable project. The whole movie was literally filmed in a warehouse. Also, for you guys out there who like nudity in your movies, don't be fooled by the R rating. If you're thinking you get a chance to see Erika Eleniak even half-naked, you're wrong. She is fully clothed throughout the entire movie. And the cover art is completely misleading! There is no scene in any part of the movie that even marginally resembles the awesome cover art they put on the box to draw unsuspecting horror fans.<br /><br />Too bad the rating is only 1 to 10. I would give this movie a -10. Be warned.

(i guess 11 films makes him a \\\"star\\\") being gay and forty, i have seen porno and i did not recognize him or his lover. personally they all look the same to me with different hair styles. face it, guys, he's no jeff stryker, jim bently or casey donovon. that's ok, though. the purpose of these films takes place in about 6.5 minutes, so they all pretty much have the same requirements, if you know what i mean.<br /><br />so glen wants to be a serious (legit) singer after he dumps the porno industry but he can't get anyone to take him seriously. i wonder why? was he so stupid to think that he could whitewash taking his clothes off and having sex on film. and according to the film it's not just porn flicks he indulges in, it's living in a house with other \\\"stars\\\" where people can hook into their bedroom, the bathroom and where ever via webcams . it's 500 dollars an hour to entertain at a private party. strip gigs at clothing optional \\\"hotels\\\". doing something called meth which i presume is a drug. and then you have the balls to get angry when someone at a club gig tries to touch you ---- because he's \\\"legit\\\" now. oy!<br /><br />the only interesting, non-cardboard character is the academy award winning gay screen writer who wouldn't give his name. and considering this is a documentary, well, porn is as porn does. you can tell he's most amused by the dumb-bunny porn star.<br /><br />glen has one hyper-nellie manager (kyle) who wants to \\\"sell' him as a porno-participant in hopes of getting him gay-club gigs. he tries to do the svengalli-routine. \\\"wear this\\\" \\\"don't smile\\\" \\\"say this\\\" in what amounts to controlling issues. but our anti-hero will not be controlled or told what to do. that's the first mistake. i'm not saying kyle was right but if any budding singer starts questioning the manager, they're not going to get far. kind of like: he who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client.<br /><br />all of this wouldn't have been bad if it weren't for one small tiny bit of information. drum roll, please. he's bad. he sucks. his singing talent ranks up there with ashlee simpson. it's hard to root for someone who -- while trying make his dream come true --- at 50! --- doesn't work like normal people. no job. can you say lazy-ass? and the whining, and the \\\"why don't they accept me.\\\" song and dance. and after a few months of scraping the surface of the music industry, he spouts off, \\\"why don't i have a record deal by now.\\\" what? actors are waiters. writers work in low-level newspapers or mags -- whatever. this guy is above that. it's true. he wants his success now merely because he decided he wanted it. whine. whine whine. his lover leaves him to return to nursing but i tell ya i wouldn't want that moron dispensing medical care to me. both of them were useless. airheads. the movie is useless. unless you really like whine and cheeesy people stay away. do not waste your money on the crappy lives of useless people, there are far more interesting things stuck to the bottom of your shoe.\",\n          \"now i like johnny vegas which is a good start, i also enjoy toilet humour<br /><br />such as young ones and bottom etc. this however failed to bring even a<br /><br />small smile to my face. the story follows johnny around after his wife<br /><br />chucks him out (how he got his good looking wife and kid i dont know) <br /><br />as he attempts to shag anything that moves. failing normally. i was looking forward to this but found it to be totally boring and a waste<br /><br />of my time altogether. unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 mins apart from wash the car then dont bother..... <br /><br />\",\n          \"this derivative erotic thriller remains watchable most of the way, mainly because a viewer is casually curious about how it will turn out, and because the director, peter hall, manages to stage a pretty hot (and quite bold) sex scene. but the finale, though unexpected, is preposterous, and the whole plotting (complete with childhood traumas and multiple-personality disorders) reveals itself to be unbearably cliched, especially as far as motivation is concerned.
